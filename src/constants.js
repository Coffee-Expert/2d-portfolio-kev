  pc: `Hey there! I'm Kevin (Coffee-Expert), a tech enthusiast who loves playing with Java, Python, and Dart. 
    Recently, I've been creating awesome stuff in JavaScript (Isn't this awesome?).
    From full-stack apps to cloud solutions, I enjoy solving problems with code. 
    Check out my projects on <a href="https://github.com/coffee-expert" target="_blank">Github</a>! to see what I've been up to! Happy coding!`,
  "cs-degree": `This is my CS degree, proudly displayed on my wall. It’s more than just paper; it’s the foundation of my tech journey. Yes!, the theory was intense, but it set me up for success in the real world.`,
  "sofa-table": `That's my sofa. I like to relax here and watch YouTube. 
  I also make Subject and concept explanations on YouTube. Go sub to  (If you are an engineering student I'm sure you'll like the content.)!`,
  tv: `That's my TV. I've been watching tech youtubers a lot recently like :
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@markiplier" target="_blank">Markiplier</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GameTheory" target="_blank">The Game Theorists</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>!`,
  bed: `This? Bed. This is where I sleep. Great ideas come to me when I'm lying in bed. If I don't write them down right away, I can't sleep because my mind won't stop thinking about them..`,
  resume: `This is my desk and on it is my resume. (Upload Pending) Contact me at abhishekevingomes@gmail.com if you have any interesting job opportunities.!`,
  projects: `Info about this portfolio: It's made with the Kaboom.js library, which is a library for making games in JavaScript. Text is rendered with HTML/CSS, so the textbox you're currently reading is not rendered within the canvas. In case you didn't see my <a href="https://github.com/coffee-expert" target="_blank">Github</a>, now's a great time.`,
  library: `There are a lot of books on my shelves. There is even one in French (I'm learning French btw. C'est une belle vie).
  I've probably only read one of them. Who else compulsively buys technical books without ever finishing them?`,
  exit: `If you want to exit Kevin's portfolio, just close this tab.`,
